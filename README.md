# .Net Solution Structure


I want something easy that i can just execute and get the folder structure for a given solution, i did some research and found some good articles and i decided to make this repo to help others like me.

The repo is about a script that creates a .Net solution with a useful folder structure and a blank solution just to start adding your projects.


[A good explanation of the structure](https://gist.github.com/davidfowl/ed7564297c61fe9ab814#file-dotnetlayout-md)


# How to use it

**Windows**

- Download the **DotNetSolution.cmd** file to your repository folder and execute it
- Enter a solution name when requested and hit enter.

The script will create the following structure of folders inside a folder with the given solution name and a blank solution with same name.

Example of solution with the name **NewProject**
